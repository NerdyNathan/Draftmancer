		<h1>MTGADraft Cube Format</h1>
		<p>
			Basic cube list is one English card name per line, just like .txt export in either Cube Cobra or Cube Tutor.
			Boosters will be 15 cards without regards for rarity distribution. Using a Custom Card List disables the following options: Restrict to Collection, Maximum rarity, Maximum duplicate copies and Foil.
			If you want to include multiple copies of the same card, add it as many times as needed to the list.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you want more control over your booster, like a custom 'rarity' distribution, you can use the following format:
			<pre>
			<code>
			[SlotName(CardPerBooster)]
			Card Name 1
			Card Name 2
			...
			[Slot2Name(CardPerBooster)]
			Card Name 3
			Card Name 4
			...
			</code>
			</pre>
			Each slot will be present in each booster. For example:
			<pre>
			<code>
			[Common(10)]
			Card Name 1
			Card Name 2
			...
			[Uncommon(3)]
			Card Name 3
			Card Name 4
			...
			[Rare(1)]
			Card Name 5
			Card Name 6
			...
			</code>
			</pre>
			Will mimic the distribution of a standard Magic booster, except for the 1/8 Mythic/Rare ratio. Cards in the 'Common' slot don't have to be 'real' commons!
			</p>
			<p>
			Why not add a special planeswalker slot in each of your booster instead of one of the commons, everyone loved them in WAR right? :D
			<pre>
			<code>
			[Planewalker(1)]
			Planewalker Card Name 1
			Planewalker Card Name 2
			...
			[Common(9)]
			Card Name 1
			Card Name 2
			...
			[Uncommon(3)]
			Card Name 3
			Card Name 4
			...
			[Rare(1)]
			Card Name 5
			Card Name 6
			...
			</code>
			</pre>
		</p>
