# Todo
 * Multiple prevention is only done by ID, maybe we should check the card name?
 
# Check
 * Handle end draft (un-ready everyone? reset session? other?)
 * Handle server booster generation errors correctly (not enough cards...)
 * Prevent multiple copies of the same card in a single booster
 * Join while drafting protection
 
# Bugs
