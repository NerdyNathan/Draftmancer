# Todo
 * Guildgates do not have localized names
 * Player limit?
 * Rarity selection
 * Multiple prevention is only done by ID, maybe we should check the card name?
 * I finally found out about socket.io room feature... I should use that instead of manually handling sessions.
 * Sealed Booster per Player option is not shared in the session.
 
# Check
 * Set Multiple Selection
 * Prevent multiple copies of the same card in a single booster
 
# Bugs
 * Guildgates won't import in arena
