			<h1>MTGADraft Cube Format</h1>
			Basic cube list is one English card name per line, just like .txt export in either Cube Cobra.
			<br />
			Boosters will be 15 cards without regards for rarity distribution. Using a Custom Card List disables the following options: Restrict to Collection, Maximum rarity,
			Maximum duplicate copies and Foil.

				<h2 id="card-spec">Advanced Card Specification</h2>
				Full syntax for a card line is inspired by the Arena Import/Export format and is defined as follows:
				<pre>[Count] CardName [(Set) [CollectorNumber]]</pre>
				All parameters between brackets ([]) are optional, only the card name is required.
				<ul>
					<li>Count (optional): How many times this card is present in the cube. Defaults to one.</li>
					<li>CardName (required): The name of the card.</li>
					<li>Set (optional): Lets you specify the edition of the card. This is the 3-letter code of the set (e.g. 'GRN' for Guilds of Ravnica).</li>
					<li>
						CollectorNumber (optional): Lets you specify an exact collector number for cards with multiple printing within a set (like Guildgates). Specifying a
						collector number without a set is NOT valid.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<section>
					<h3>Examples</h3>
					The four following lines are equivalent and will add one copy of 'Incubation Druid' from Ravnica Allegiance. Here the set and collector number are both
					redundant as there's only one printing of the card (in Arena, and as of May 2020 :)):
					<pre>
1 Incubation Druid (RNA) 131
1 Incubation Druid (RNA)
1 Incubation Druid
Incubation Druid</pre
					>
					This will add 8 copies of the full art "Unset" Forest:
					<pre>8 Forest (ANA) 60</pre>
					This will add one copy of each of the two version (#243 & #244) of the Azorius Guildgate of RNA:
					<pre>
1 Azorius Guildgate (RNA) 243
1 Azorius Guildgate (RNA) 244</pre
					>
				</section>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2 id="slots">Slots</h2>
				If you want more control over your booster, like a custom 'rarity' distribution, you can use the following format:
				<pre>
[SlotName(CardsPerBooster)]
Card Name 1
Card Name 2
...
[Slot2Name(CardsPerBooster)]
Card Name 3
Card Name 4
...</pre
				>
				Each slot will be present in each booster. For example:
				<pre>
[Common(10)]
Card Name 1
Card Name 2
...
[Uncommon(3)]
Card Name 3
Card Name 4
...
[Rare(1)]
Card Name 5
Card Name 6
...</pre
				>
				Will mimic the distribution of a standard Magic booster, except for the 1/8 Mythic/Rare ratio. Cards in the 'Common' slot don't have to be 'real' commons! Why not
				add a special planeswalker slot in each of your booster instead of one of the commons, everyone loved them in WAR right? :D
				<pre>
[Planewalker(1)]
Planewalker Card Name 1
Planewalker Card Name 2
...
[Common(9)]
Card Name 1
Card Name 2
...
[Uncommon(3)]
Card Name 3
Card Name 4
...
[Rare(1)]
Card Name 5
Card Name 6
...</pre
				>
				Color balancing (if enabled) will be used only on the largest slot (in terms of cards per booster) and if it consist of at least 5 cards per booster. In both
				previous examples, the 'Common' slot will be color balanced if the option is enabled (which is the default value).
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2 id="layouts">Pack Layouts</h2>
				<p>
					For even more control, you can specify multiple
					<strong>Pack Layouts</strong>
					describing variations of a pack, each with an associated weight (or probability to be chosen).
					<strong>Important Note:</strong>
					When using pack layouts, slots should be declared without a
					<code>CardsPerBooster</code>
					parameter. Every layouts should contain the same total number of cards.
				</p>
				<p>
					After the
					<code>[Layouts]</code>
					header, the syntax of a layout is as follow:
				</p>
				<pre>
- LayoutName (Weight)
  7 SlotName1
  3 SlotName2</pre
				>
				<p>
					Where
					<code>Weight</code>
					is an integer specifying how often this layout will be chosen when generating a pack. In this example, each pack will contain
					<code>7</code>
					cards picked from
					<code>SlotName1</code>
					(user defined card list) and
					<code>3</code>
					cards picked from
					<code>SlotName2</code>
					.
				</p>
				<p>Example implementing a mythic rarity:</p>
				<pre>
[Layouts]
- Rare (7)
  10 Common
  3 Uncommon
  1 Rare
- Mythic (1)
  10 Common
  3 Uncommon
  1 Mythic
[Common]
..Card List..
[Uncommon]
..Card List..
[Rare]
..Card List..
[Mythic]
..Card List..</pre
				>
				<p>More complex example mimicking the collation of Dominaria United (Exactly one legendary creature of varying rarity in each pack):</p>
				<pre>
[Layouts]
- Rare (21)
  10 Common
  2 Uncommon
  1 UncommonLegendary
  1 Rare
- Mythic (3)
  10 Common
  2 Uncommon
  1 UncommonLegendary
  1 Mythic
- RareLegendary (7)
  10 Common
  3 Uncommon
  1 RareLegendary
- MythicLegendary (1)
  10 Common
  3 Uncommon
  1 MythicLegendary

				<h2 id="custom-cards">Custom Cards</h2>
				A cube can also be composed of user-defined cards specified as JSON data. The CustomCards section must be the first one in the file. Once defined in this section,
				custom cards can be refered to by name in slots, just like regular cards.
